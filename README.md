## Goal

- Using given websocket server URL, fetch the data.
- On each update, fetched data is shown in a tablular format.
- Based on this details, showcasing a graph based for the first city from the list.

## Decisions

- To avoid errors while updating the data, functional logic has been added to handle updation of existing city details and add new cities.
- Currently, due to time constraints, the graph only shows details for the city in the list.

## Future Aspects

- Upon clicking on any of the city name, graph should be able to change showing details for that city.

## Available Scripts

- yarn add or npm install to install all the dependencies in the project.
- npm or yarn start to start the server.

## Current deployment

- condescending-aryabhata-1df8eb.netlify.app
- Currently there are some issues with netlify `build` command, so the site might not be up
